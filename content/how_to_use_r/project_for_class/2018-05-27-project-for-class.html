<p>How to a) get the files needed for each chapter in class and b) how to follow along with each chapter/code through.</p>
<div id="getting-files-and-folders" class="section level2">
<h2>Getting files and folders</h2>
<p>The files for this class will include the raw data, the scripts, and r markdown files.</p>
<p>There are a few options to download them:</p>
<div id="install-the-package-ive-created-for-this-class" class="section level3">
<h3>1) Install the package I’ve created for this class</h3>
<p>Each chapter has a prompt to download the files associated with each one.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you’ve created a <strong>New Project</strong> on your computer in your <code>Documents</code> folder called <code>learning-r</code> or something like that. This will create a <em>.rProj</em> file and keep the working directory relative to that folder and all data and scripts should go in there.</p>
<p>Once you’ve set your working directory (with maybe <code>setwd()</code>) then you can run these commands in your console to download the correct folders and data:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;usethis&quot;)

# This is for chapter 2 files and folders

usethis::use_course(&quot;https://github.com/r-journalism/learn-chapter-2/archive/master.zip&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>These project files work because the working directory will be <strong>relative</strong> to the project/chapter folder and not to an <strong>absolute</strong> folder path. Double click the <em>.rProj</em> file in each project/chapter folder to open it in RStudio.</p>
</div>
<div id="download-the-entire-repo-off-github" class="section level3">
<h3>2) Download the entire repo off Github</h3>
<p>Each repo that begins with <code>learn-chapter-X</code> has files and folders for each chapter we’re going through. You can clone or repo each one and open the .Rproj file in each of those folders to follow along.</p>
</div>
<div id="follow-from-scratch" class="section level3">
<h3>3) Follow from scratch</h3>
<p>Alternatively, you could create the files yourself from scratch with the correct folder structure. This is pretty tough for beginners but useful to really understand how project and folder structures work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new project in RStudio right now and call it learning-r-journalism</li>
<li>Save all your scripts and your data into here for now (ideally with an organized folder structure)</li>
<li>Data referenced in each chapter/sub-chapter can be downloaded individually from their respective repos
<ul>
<li>create new folders following the structure of the code in each walk through and place data downloaded from the repos as indicated</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<div id="following-the-code-through" class="section level2">
<h2>Following the code through</h2>
<p>Each sub chapter has a <strong>.Rmd</strong> file that contains the scripted code for each walk through.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/how_to_use_r/project_for_class/images/rmd_file.png?classes=shadow" />

</div>
<p>This is an R Markdown file, which we will explain in detail in chapter 6.</p>
<p>But for now, the important thing to understand is that it’s a mix of markdown text and R code.</p>
<p>The R code sections are indicated by the grayed out areas.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/how_to_use_r/project_for_class/images/r_chunks.png?classes=shadow" />

</div>
<p>Each section can be executed with the green triangle button on the right.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/how_to_use_r/project_for_class/images/run_current_chunk.png?classes=shadow" />

</div>
<p>If you get an error, it might be because you didn’t run a chunk of code above. This is essentially an R script broken up into pieces and separated by text. Code depends on code executing above it successfully.</p>
<p>Here’s how to run code above a current chunk:</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="the-ideal-way-to-follow-along" class="section level2">
<h2>The ideal way to follow along</h2>
<p>Do as much manually as you can.</p>
<p>After you get the files and folders, open a new script file and write out the code written in each video and sub chapter code through. An R script of only the code for each section is also in each folder. Avoid using that unless you have to.</p>
<p>Avoid just running code chunks in R Markdown.</p>
<p>Avoid copying and pasting the code.</p>
<p>Avoid passively learning.</p>
<p>Manually typing out your code starts the muscle memory and problem solving training.</p>
<p><strong>That being said</strong>, if you get stuck, use that code that I’ve provided however you want.</p>

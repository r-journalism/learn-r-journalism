Comma separated files are the most common way to save spreadsheets that doesn't require a paid program from Microsoft to open.

## What a csv file looks like

CSV file names end with a **.csv**

## What a csv file looks like on the inside

This explains the values separated with commas part of the file name.

# Importing CSV files

- Importing CSV is part of base R, no package needed
- But we're going to use a package anyway, **readr**

## Two ways to get data

* If you have the URL address
    * If the csv file exists on the internet, you don’t have to download it to your local machine and then import it, you can import it to R directly from the web using the link
* If you have the file on your computer

## Get the URL



If you have the link to a CSV file, right click [the link](https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/Admissions-to-DMHAS-Addiction-Treatment-by-Town-Ye/iyru-82zq/data) of the data and click **Copy Link Address**. This data set can be found on the [Connecticut Open Data Portal](https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/Admissions-to-DMHAS-Addiction-Treatment-by-Town-Ye/iyru-82zq/).

## read.csv()

The Base R function to import a CSV file is `read.csv()`. Just put the URL address in quotation marks and add the `stringsAsFactors=F` (In this code we're using the function `head()`-- this returns 6 rows by default, but we want to look at 10, so we’ll specify that when we call the function head(data, 10))

```{r segment1}
df_csv <- read.csv("https://data.ct.gov/api/views/iyru-82zq/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", stringsAsFactors=F)
head(df_csv, 10)
```


## The other way to import the data: Download it

When you right click on the link, instead of clicking **Copy Link Address**-- this time, click **Save Link As...**

![](/importing_exporting/csv/images/downloading.png?classes=shadow)

Save to your working directory.

After saving to the directory, click on the circle arrow on the right to refresh the files to make sure it's there.

![](/importing_exporting/csv/images/directory.png?classes=shadow)

## Recall: How to change directories in RStudio

Either by typing `setwd("/directory/where/you/want")` or by clicking in the menu up top **Session > Set Working Directory > Choose Directory...**

![](/importing_exporting/csv/images/setwd.png?classes=shadow)

## Importing local csv data

Just like before, except instead of the URL, it's the name of the file.

**Note:** This will only work if the working directory is set to where the csv file is.
```{r segment2}
df_csv <- read.csv("data/Admissions_to_DMHAS_Addiction_Treatment_by_Town__Year__and_Month.csv", stringsAsFactors=F)
```


## stringsAsFactors=F

Why? 

Blame statisticians.

Back when R was created the users weren't using it as we use it now, with all these different strings.

**What happens when you don't use `stringsAsFactors=F`**

```{r segment3}
df_csv <- read.csv("data/Admissions_to_DMHAS_Addiction_Treatment_by_Town__Year__and_Month.csv")
str(df_csv)
```



##Using read_csv() from the readr package

**readr** is a package that read rectangular data quickly and assumes characters are strings and not factors by default.

```{r segment4}
## If you don't have readr installed yet, uncomment and run the line below
#install.packages("readr")
library(readr)
df_csv <- read_csv("data/Admissions_to_DMHAS_Addiction_Treatment_by_Town__Year__and_Month.csv")
```

As you can see, the `read_csv()` function interpreted the **MonthYear** and **Town** columns as characters and not as Factors as `read.csv()` did.

# Exporting CSV files

When you're done analyzing or transforming your data, you can save your dataframe as a CSV file with `write_csv()` from the **readr** package.

```{r export1, eval=F}
# Pass the write_csv() function the name of the dataframe and what you want to call the file
write_csv(df_csv, "transformed_data.csv")
```

The file will save to your working directory, but you can specify sub directories with the function.

```{r export2, eval=F}
# Pass the write_csv() function the name of the dataframe and what you want to call the file
write_csv(df_csv, "data/transformed_data.csv")
```

## Exporting data frames with `NA` 

Weird quirk alert: Exported files will include `NA`s so to replace them, pass the variable `na="whatever"`. 

```{r export3, eval=F}
# This replaces the NAs with blanks
write_csv(df_csv, "data/transformed_data.csv", na="")
```
